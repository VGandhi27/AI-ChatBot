  "text": "Research paper authored by Vidushi Gandhi are 'SVM-Based Framework for Breast Cancer Detection', published in SpringerLink on September 19, 2024, addresses the critical challenge of early breast cancer detection. Given the alarming statistics from the WHO in 2020, where over 2.35 million individuals were diagnosed and more than 690,000 lost their lives to breast cancer, this research aims to enhance detection efficiency using machine learning. The study evaluates K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression (LR) algorithms, with SVM achieving the highest accuracy of 95.5%. The paper emphasizes the importance of early and precise detection in reducing mortality rates, demonstrating how ML techniques can revolutionize cancer diagnosis and patient outcomes.Similarly,This is the second research paper authored by Vidushi Gandhi 'Analysing the Causes of Mood Disorders: A Comprehensive Study', published in the International Journal of Computational Modeling and Physical Sciences (IJCMPS) on July 5, 2024, explores the increasing prevalence of depression and mood disorders. The WHO's 2020 report highlights that over 380 million people suffer from depression, with more than 1.05 million deaths linked to it globally. This research leverages machine learning models, including KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression, to detect and classify depression levels. The study's primary contribution lies in identifying key features affecting depression detection, aiming to facilitate early diagnosis and intervention. This work underscores the potential of AI-driven solutions in addressing mental health challenges.These research showcases how machine learning can be instrumental in healthcare diagnostics, offering promising solutions for both physical and mental health concerns."
